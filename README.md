# summer-reu-bioinformatics2016
All files related to the research that was begun in the summer of 2016 working with CofC on ADAM.

Within this repo you will find the testing of code that was put forth on http://bdgenomics.org/blog/2015/02/02/scalable-genomes-clustering-with-adam-and-spark/


This is my testing of the methods that have been put forth on the blog. My goal is to improve what I can and make a web application to assist the common biologist in their attempts to pursue the knowledge of the world.
